The moon is in Pisces.</p><h2>Aries (March 21-April 19)</h2><p>You feel hopeful. It might be a private feeling you have; nevertheless, it’s there. It’s really a matter of having faith in your own future, isn’t it? You feel concerned for the welfare of others, especially those who are less fortunate than you. (Noble feelings.)</p><h2>Taurus (April 20-May 20)</h2><p>You’ll enjoy being with others, especially old friends you know well. You feel a genuine concern for their welfare. Meanwhile, it’s a great day to deal with clubs and organizations because you will find that group efforts will give you the best results and productivity. “Go, team, go!”</p><h2>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</h2><p>Make the best use of the fact that the moon is at the top of your chart dancing with lucky Jupiter, which makes you look successful to others! People admire you today! (In fact, they seem to know personal details about your private life.) Make a great impression!</p><h2>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</h2><p>Explore opportunities to travel, especially with a group. Likewise, you might also be involved with a group that’s related to higher education, publishing, the media or even something to do with the law and medicine. Remember Col. Saito? “Be happy in your work!”</p><h2>Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)</h2><p>This is an excellent day for discussions about inheritances or how to divide something because all parties involved will be pleased with the results. (Especially you.) It’s a great day to fundraise and get the cooperation of others regarding their assets and resources. (“Gimme what ya got.”)</p><h2>Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)</h2><p>Enjoy schmoozing with partners, spouses and close friends today. Make plans to meet for lunch, coffee or Happy Hour so that you can share in the laughter and good times with others. This is a positive day and people are in a happy mood! In particular, you will enjoy being involved in a group setting.</p><h2>Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)</h2><p>Work-related travel is likely today. If you experience this, it will be a pleasant and broadening trip in which you will learn something, and, perhaps, enjoy the company of a group. You might also see ways to use the wealth, assets or resources of someone else to your benefit.</p><h2>Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)</h2><p>Oh happy day! Enjoy fun activities with kids. Sports events, social outings, the entertainment world and show business will also be pleasant choices for you today. Great day for a long lunch and happy times shared with others. If you can swing this, you’ll feel good to be part of a team.</p><h2>Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)</h2><p>Family members or other people might meet at your home, which will please you. This is because any kind of gathering will yield a productive result for you today; therefore, let people pitch in and help you! “Many hands make light work.”</p><h2>Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)</h2><p>Because you’re in such a positive frame of mind, you can’t go wrong. You will be skilled at encouraging others to join you in your efforts and do your bidding. Or possibly, it’s the other way around, and you will join a group? Either way, your interaction with others today will benefit you.</p><h2>Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)</h2><p>Business and commerce are blessed today. Look for ways to boost your income. Be open to new money-making ideas, especially if they involve dealing with a group or dealing with foreign interests or people from other cultures.</p><h2>Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)</h2><p>Today the moon is in your sign dancing with lucky Jupiter, which makes you feel good. In particular, this is a great day for any kind of group activity. You’ll be persuasive if you’re in sales and PR work.</p><h2>If Your Birthday Is Today</h2><p>Actress Jenna Ortega (2002) shares your birthday. You are deep and complex. Your range of feelings and distinct personality makes a strong impression on others. This year is about learning and teaching. Take time to explore your spiritual or religious beliefs. Use some solitude to get closer to the true meaning of your life.<br></p>",

Ross avoided bringing in&nbsp;<b>Mark Leiter Jr.</b>&nbsp;all series against the Rockies, suggesting Leiter was dealing with an injury, although not one serious enough to force a stint on the injured list right away.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHard-throwing&nbsp;<b>Julian Merryweather</b>&nbsp;struggled with command in his last three outings, issuing two walks in each.</p><p>\tA loss of command can be a sign that a physical ailment is throwing mechanics out of whack. But the Cubs think they have identified the mechanical root of the problem and hope they’ll be able to get Merryweather back on track.</p><p><b>Candelario close to return</b></p><p>\tThe Cubs had hoped corner infielder&nbsp;<b>Jeimer Candelario</b>&nbsp;(strained lower back) might be ready to return from the 10-day IL on Tuesday. Instead, he went through a slate of baseball activities before the game, continuing his rehab.</p><p>\t‘‘He’s really, really close,’’ Ross said.</p><p>\tCandelario might take live batting practice against Alzolay on Wednesday.<br></p>",

Right fielder Seiya Suzuki was set up under Sean Murphy’s fly with two outs, waving off center fielder Cody Bellinger.</p><p>\tThen, at the last second, the ball disappeared in the lights and fell to the grass as Suzuki stabbed at it. The tying and go-ahead runs scored.</p><p>\t‘‘That did contribute to that play happening,’’ Suzuki said through an interpreter when he was asked if he lost the ball in the lights. ‘‘But ever since I was playing in Japan, you do have to take that into consideration whenever you go out there. So if I do say that, then that’s an excuse. So I’m not going to say that.’’</p><p>\tPlenty of other moments could be used to pick apart the Cubs’ 7-6 loss, but the error by Suzuki was the ultimate turning point.</p><p>\tThe result enabled the Brewers to clinch the National League Central and dropped the Cubs a game behind the Diamondbacks in the battle for the second NL wild-card spot. It cut their lead over the Marlins in the race for the third — and final — spot to a half-game.</p><p>\t‘‘Seiya has been carrying us for over a month and a half offensively,’’ manager David Ross said. ‘‘He’s put us on his back. A lot of guys have been scuffling, and he’s been the guy who’s swinging the bat the best. So we’re not going to highlight one mistake.’’</p><p><a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2023/8/27/23848306/playing-free-seiya-suzukis-reset-helping-power-cubs-offense-pirates-brewers-division\"  target=\"_blank\"   >Suzuki</a> has been one of the hottest hitters in the majors. He entered play Tuesday with the highest OPS (1.110) in the NL since Aug. 18, and his 2-for-5 night against the Braves included a two-run triple.</p><p>\t‘‘I’m happy for those comments,’’ Suzuki said of the support he received from Ross and his teammates. ‘‘But, obviously, these games are really, really important for us. And the fact that we dropped it is obviously not the best result that we want right now at this point in the season.’’</p><p>\tOn paper, the Cubs have the toughest schedule among the wild-card hopefuls to end the season. They have two more games against the Braves before finishing with three against the Brewers in Milwaukee. They likely have to take at least one game in Atlanta to stay competitive. And with ace Justin Steele on the mound Tuesday, they gave themselves a shot.</p><p>\tSteele kept the Braves’ offense quiet through five innings, giving the Cubs’ hitters time to build a 6-0 lead. He was charged with three runs in 5⅓ innings.</p><p>\tHis night included six consecutive strikeouts from the second through the fourth before Ross started noticing signs that he was ‘‘running out of gas’’ in the sixth.</p><p>\tKevin Pillar led off the sixth with the Braves’ major-league-leading 300th home run. Then with one out, Steele gave up a double, a walk and an RBI single.</p><p>\t‘‘Those situations are always tough because the competitor in me wants to stay out there,’’ Steele said. ‘‘But you also have to put trust in the staff, knowing what situations are coming about, who’s coming up in the order, what we have down in the bullpen, the matchups.’’</p><p>\tJose Cuas yielded an RBI double to Marcell Ozuna right away but got out of the sixth with a three-run lead.</p><p>\tJavier Assad allowed a two-run homer to Ronald Acuna Jr. in the seventh, and the crowd broke into ‘‘M-V-P’’ chants as the Braves pulled to 6-5.</p><p>\tDrew Smyly took over in the eighth and appeared to get out of the inning before Suzuki missed the would-be final out.</p><p>\t‘‘It happens to every single one of us,’’ Smyly said. ‘‘We’ve all made errors. All we can do is turn the page and come back tomorrow.’’<br></p>",

As we move through October and November, we’ll start focusing more on what we need to do to put the best team forward for next year and years further.”</p><p>\tWhether shortstop <a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2023/9/20/23882496/tim-anderson-pushing-toward-finish-of-most-difficult-season\"  target=\"_blank\"   >Tim Anderson</a> is part of what the Sox do in 2024 remains to be seen. One of Getz’s first order of business might be deciding if he picks up Anderson’s $14 million option, and he didn’t make it sound like Anderson returning is a lock.</p><p>\t“He’s meant so much to this organization,” Getz said. “He’s been an impactful player for this ballclub. We’re going to have discussions on the best step forward for the White Sox. Whether that be TA playing shortstop for us or not, yeah, there’s an option there that needs to be discussed and it deserves an exhaustive discussion just because of what he’s meant to this organization.”</p><p>\tWhile Anderson is finishing strong on the batting average side, he still has only one home run in what has been his worst season. Shortstop prospect Colson Montgomery is waiting in the wings, although playing him on Opening Day would probably be a rush job.</p><p>\t“You’ve seen flashes of [Anderson’s] ability to drive a ball into the gap,” Getz said. “You see his contact ability. Unfortunately, you just haven’t seen the consistency you have in the past. But there’s plenty of life left in his game that we feel like he can still be a productive major-league player. I know he’s been frustrated.”</p><p>\tThe consistency on defense for Anderson, who mis-timed covering second on a force play and was charged with his 14th error in the midst of a six-run Diamondbacks fifth inning, could be better, too. His offense has stood out, though.</p><p>\t“There’s been some injuries along the way that have affected his lower half,” Getz said. “Anyone that’s hit knows it starts from the ground up, and I think that’s probably affected him from time to time. But all in all, he’s been frustrated with the production, and we know he’s capable of doing more. It’s a matter of when and how it’s going to come out.”</p><p>\tThe Sox led 4-1 on Eloy Jimenez’s three-run homer and RBI single, but the Diamondbacks, behind two homers and a triple from Christian Walker, stormed back. An uninspiring Sox pitching quintet of Jose Urena, Yohan Ramirez, Declan Cronin and Lane Ramsey was no match.</p><p>\tGetz might have more to offer when the general meetings roll around in early November. He declined to comment on what the 2024 starting rotation might look like. And he said coaching staff changes haven’t been decided, although he mentioned pitching coach Ethan Katz’s past connections to new director of pitching Brian Bannister, “who’s going to be involved in all levels of pitching, whether it be at the major-league level or the minors, the Dominican academy, and on the acquisition side.”</p><p>\tAny kind of help is welcome.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

And federal agencies will halt all work deemed non-essential. </p><p></p><p>There are 42,637 federal employees in Illinois as of March 2023, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. That number includes federal law enforcement and 22,600 active duty military members. Under a shutdown, all active-duty service members and some law enforcement officers would remain at work but receive no pay until funds are appropriated.</p><p> Employees at the Great Lakes Naval Base in Lake County    such as Petty Officer Second Class Madison Williams wouldn’t receive a paycheck, forcing them to get creative to make ends meet without it.</p><p>“That’s how we pay our rent. That’s how we pay for groceries,” said Williams, 29. “A lot of people that don’t have savings ... we have to dive into our credit cards.”</p><p>“Excepted” federal employees will not be furloughed, including those whose work involves “emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,” according to the office.  </p><p>Environmental Protection Agency inspections at hazardous waste sites, drinking water and chemical facilities would stop. And about 10,000 children across the country would immediately lose slots for Head Start, an early development program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to the White House. </p><p>The longest government shutdown lasted 34 days late 2018 into early 2019 — led by a stalemate between former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over his request for a $5.7 billion border wall. This time, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is battling with far right House members who want to severely cut spending levels.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Senate, Democrats and Republicans are working on an appropriations plan to fund the government at higher levels, with money for Ukraine and emergency disaster aid.</p><p>But the clock is loudly ticking toward an Oct. 1 deadline. Government funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Oct. 1, the beginning of the federal budget year.</p><p><b>LOAN HELP FOR UNPAID WORKERS:</b></p><p>In 2019, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and the Illinois Treasurer’s office offered $100 million in state funds on low-interest or zero-interest loans to federal workers whose paychecks were  halted.&nbsp;Pritzker on Tuesday said he is working closely with Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs to reinstate the program. </p><p>“If Republicans in Congress do not successfully do their jobs and fund the government by October 1, millions will be impacted across the nation. Here in Illinois, we are doing everything in our power to help and will be prepared to support our federal employees,” Pritzker said in a statement to the Sun-Times. “We are home to more than 40,000 federal employees, and even if their paychecks are delayed, their bills, mortgage payments, and loans will keep adding up.”</p><p><b>TRAVEL:</b></p><p>Air traffic controllers and TSA officers would also be working without pay, which could lead to huge delays and longer wait times at airports. During the last shutdown, a large number of TSA agents called off work because of the economic hardships they faced having no paycheck for five weeks.</p><p>A pressure point in the 2019 government shutdown was the chaos it created at several major airports, where not enough TSA agents and air traffic controllers could navigate the country’s air traffic system.&nbsp;</p><p><b>MILITARY</b>:</p><p> The Great Lakes Naval Base, about 30 miles north of Chicago,   is the U.S. Navy’s only boot camp, where more than 18,600 people would be impacted by a shutdown —&nbsp;including 10,000 recruits in basic training and sailors and 5,000 military staff.</p><p>Some of the 3,600 civilian employees employed at the base who do not perform excepted activities would be furloughed and wouldn’t be authorized to work, according to Great Lakes spokesman John Sheppard. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Williams, who has worked at the naval base for around year, said she and her coworkers have been doing research on organizations that may be able to assist, and are making preparations in case the shutdown is prolonged, if it happens. </p><p>“Pretty much everybody is just trying to do their research and see what entities are going to help them the most,” Williams said, adding that she has looked into the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, which can provide interest free loans.</p><p>“I also haven’t been making any frivolous purchases or anything like that, making sure that I have food to go on, and looking at other organizations that maybe give food out,” Williams said.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just hope it ends soon,” Williams said.</p><p><b>VETERANS’ BENEFITS AND HEALTHCARE:</b></p><p>At a news conference on Friday, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough said there would be no impact on veterans’ health care and that benefits would still be administered. The only disruptions would be the closing of regional offices, and some impact on services for veterans like outreach and career counseling. </p><p><b>U.S. POSTAL SERVICE:</b></p><p>The U.S. Postal Service — an independent agency — and its employees would not be affected  by a shutdown, meaning mail services would not be affected. </p><p><b>WHAT WOULD THE SHUTDOWN MEAN FOR FEDERAL COURT?</b></p><p>U.S. District Court officials on Tuesday announced that federal court would continue to operate if no deal is reached by Monday. They also predicted it could continue paid operations using various funds through Oct. 13.</p><p>However, they said the court would be forced to suspend all civil litigation involving the federal government. And, if the shutdown continues beyond Oct. 13, court employees could be required to report to work with no expectation of pay until the shutdown is over.</p><p>U.S. District Chief Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer<b> </b>and Clerk Thomas Bruton have determined all court employees are “excepted” from furlough.</p><p>“Any interruptions in the court’s operations are of grave concern,” Pallmeyer said in a statement. “We have a large number of criminal and civil jury trials scheduled to proceed this fall, and a lack of appropriation would seriously delay us in meeting our responsibilities to dispense justice in a timely manner.” </p><p>Among the trials scheduled to begin this fall are the Oct. 10 trial of six alleged O-Block gang members <a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/1/28/22907047/fbg-duck-murder-case-gold-coast-o-block-street-gang\"  target=\"_blank\"   >accused in the murder of the rapper FBG Duck</a>, whose real name was Carlton Weekly. <a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/5/30/18646020/chicago-alderman-edward-burke-indictment\"  target=\"_blank\"   >Former Chicago Ald. Edward M. Burke</a> is also set for trial Nov. 6.</p><p>“This situation is obviously unacceptable,” Pallmeyer said. “Our Court employees are dedicated public servants, determined to keep the wheels of justice turning. But many of them live paycheck to paycheck; if we are unable to pay them, these staff members will be faced with tough financial decisions that will impact their families and the greater community.”</p><p><i>Contributing: Jon Seidel</i></p><p></p>",

The Emmy and Tony award winner will be recognized for his work through his <a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.garysinisefoundation.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   >Gary Sinise Foundation</a>.</p><p>Sinise’s foundation — which launched in 2011 — honors military members, veterans, first responders, their families and those in need. Some of his charitable efforts include building adapted homes for severely wounded veterans and first responders, uplifting military members and families through entertainment, mental wellness programs and financial support in crucial moments.</p><p>Sinise, a co-founder of Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre Company, co-starred in “Apollo 13” and “Forrest Gump,” playing a seriously wounded Vietnam War veteran, and led the cast of “NCIS: NY” for nine seasons.</p><p>AARP also said 10 named Purpose Prize fellows will also be honored. Each of them will receive a $10,000 award to further the mission of their organization.</p><p>AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins said the recipients are “shining examples of a simple, yet profound truth.”</p><p>“When we find our sense of purpose — that certain something that gives us a reason to get up and get going every day — we not only give meaning to our own lives; we make the world a better place for everyone,” Jenkins said.</p><p>AARP also announced the return of its Inspire Award for a third year. The general public can vote for the AARP Purpose Prize winner they want to win the award, which grants the recipient an additional $10,000 for their organization.<br></p>",

The board also rejected the FOP’s stopgap request to stay the cases.</p><p>John Catanzara, the fiery union chief, has argued that other public workers are already afforded the option of going to an arbitrator, and police are being held to another standard. After learning of the police board ruling, Catanzara insisted “there is absolutely nothing that is going to prevent this from taking place and becoming a reality.”&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re going to end up making officers very wealthy because we’re going to encourage these officers and maybe even assist them in suing the city, the police board and everybody,” Catanzara said. “Because this is just ridiculous.”</p><p>Benn ruled in June that officers facing dismissal or suspensions over a year could opt to move their proceedings to arbitration instead of going before the board. The move is an outgrowth of lengthy labor negotiations between the city and the FOP, which is still operating under a contract that expired in mid-2017.</p><p>The decision has faced <a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/14/23873944/chicago-city-council-reject-ruling-serious-police-misconduct-out-public-view\"  target=\"_blank\"   >sharp criticism from progressive alderpersons</a>, the president of the city’s civilian-led police oversight panel and dozens of police district council members, who wrote an open letter urging City Council to vote it down last week.&nbsp;</p><p>“Allowing the most severe cases of misconduct to be handled behind closed doors threatens to undermine the very fabric of accountability and transparency that our communities rely upon,” Alexander Perez, Wentworth District council member, said in a news release. “We must safeguard the public’s trust in the integrity of law enforcement processes, especially at this crucial time.”</p><p>The police board ruling serves as a short-term victory for those officials and police reform advocates, although it’s unclear when City Council will begin weighing in on Benn’s decision.</p><p>The FOP filed its motion to move the cases on Aug. 11, framing it as a “combined grievance” on behalf of the 22 cops while arguing that the police board had “lost jurisdiction” based on Benn’s decision. The supplemental request to stay the proceedings was made to avoid potential legal fees that could be racked up during subsequent arbitration cases.</p><p>Interim Police Supt. Fred Waller argued on Sept. 1 that the FOP wasn’t a party to the cases, adding that Benn’s decision hadn’t been ratified and would be subject to legal challenges. He insisted that process could take years and any delay would impact the cases brought by him and other superintendents.</p><p>The board similarly found that the FOP’s motion was improperly filed, although the ruling acknowledged that some officers had adopted it as their own and effectively set aside the issue in Tuesday’s ruling.</p><p>Instead, the board focused on its inability to hand off the cases, citing the municipal code and the FOP’s latest collective bargaining agreement. The board also rejected the effort to stay the cases by pointing to the “uncertainty as to whether and when” Benn’s decision would take effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Police Board President Ghian Foreman and six other members voted in favor of the ruling. Two others didn’t vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Catanzara said the board has “made this beyond personal and ridiculous.”</p><p>“They’ve never had much intent on giving any officers a fair shake,” he added.<br></p>",

Anthony Beale (9th) wants to give voters their first opportunity ever to determine whether Chicago remains a sanctuary city. </p><p>Beale plans to introduce a resolution asking his City Council colleagues to put a binding referendum on the March ballot, asking this question: “Should the city of Chicago continue to keep its designation as a Sanctuary City?”</p><p>If the answer is, “Yes,” the caravans that have brought over 15,000 migrants to Chicago — including 18 busloads last week, 12 more over the weekend and eight more busloads and two more flights on Tuesday — will continue. </p><p>Mayor Brandon Johnson would proceed with plans for the giant tent cities he prefers to call “winterized base camps” to move more than 2,000 asylum-seekers off the floors of Chicago police stations and O’Hare and Midway airports before temperatures plummet.</p><p>But to get the question on the ballot, Beale first needs 26 alderpersons to vote for it. That won’t be easy in a Council controlled by allies of the most progressive mayor in Chicago history.</p><p>Beale knows it’s an uphill battle, but is determined to stop the bleeding.</p><p>“You have people who have been living here their entire lives being denied basic services and goods. Yet we can find this kind of money to basically take it out back, put it in a barrel and burn it up. ...  The amount of money we’re spending is absurd,” Beale said.</p><p></p><p>“If you were to give my ward $40 million or $50 million a year, I could transform my ward. … It would be a different community in a matter of a couple of years. If we can find money for this, why can’t we find money for people who are here paying into the system?”</p><div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center>\n        <div class=\"Enhancement-item\">\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            <figure class=\"Figure\">\n    \n        <picture>\n    \n    \n        \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n            <source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8c510a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+106/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FQsCMhcYq8zVR7lB00QH60qnfWs0%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1333%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281000x667%3A1001x668%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24871359%2FMIGRANTS_050223_06.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/212a52a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+106/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FQsCMhcYq8zVR7lB00QH60qnfWs0%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1333%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281000x667%3A1001x668%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24871359%2FMIGRANTS_050223_06.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    />\n\n    \n\n    \n        <source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21c4685/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+106/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FQsCMhcYq8zVR7lB00QH60qnfWs0%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1333%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281000x667%3A1001x668%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24871359%2FMIGRANTS_050223_06.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    />\n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    <img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Neislymar Gonzalez, 24, a migrant from Venezuela, with her 4-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, was staying at the Chicago Police Department’s Central District station in May.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21c4685/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+106/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FQsCMhcYq8zVR7lB00QH60qnfWs0%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1333%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281000x667%3A1001x668%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24871359%2FMIGRANTS_050223_06.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27d69ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+106/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FQsCMhcYq8zVR7lB00QH60qnfWs0%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1333%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281000x667%3A1001x668%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24871359%2FMIGRANTS_050223_06.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21c4685/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+106/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FQsCMhcYq8zVR7lB00QH60qnfWs0%3D%2F0x0%3A2000x1333%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal%281000x667%3A1001x668%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24871359%2FMIGRANTS_050223_06.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        >\n\n\n</picture>\n\n    \n\n    \n        <div class=\"Figure-content\"><figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"><p>Neislymar Gonzalez, 24, a migrant from Venezuela, with her 4-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, was staying at the Chicago Police Department’s Central District station in May.</p></figcaption><span class=\"line\"></span><div class=\"Figure-credit\"><p>Natalie Garcia/For the Sun-Times</p></div></div>\n    \n</figure>\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        </div>\n    </div><p>It’s been 38 years since Mayor Harold Washington issued an executive order declaring Chicago a “sanctuary city,” allowing undocumented people to access city services and live without fear of police harassment or city cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The policy led to what is known as the “welcoming city” ordinance.</p><p>Never once have Chicago voters been asked for their permission, Beale said.</p><p>“If the people say ‘Yes,’ so be it. Let’s proceed raising everybody’s taxes. Let’s proceed spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year. But if we’re going to stop the bleeding, we need to do something different because it’s only going to get worse. Today, it’s $500 million. Tomorrow, it’s $1 billion. Who’s paying for that? The same people who are being denied services.”</p><p>Cristina Pacione-Zayas, Johnson’s deputy chief of staff, dismissed Beale’s resolution as political theater — and not an “overnight solution” to the migrant crisis. </p><p>“He’s got to get it through the City Council. Get enough signatures to get it on the ballot. Then go through the process with the voters. And then, there’ll be a host of other ... ordinances and state implications that will invalidate it,” she said.</p><p>“Since we are a sanctuary state and ... have several pieces of legislation that protect that, he’s basically inviting some type of fight with the state. ...

We need to figure out how to integrate people more — not shut people out,” he said.  </p><p></p><p>Ubaldo Aguilar,  executive director of immigrant rights organization Centro de Trabajadores Unidos, championed reforms passed in 2021 that eliminated exceptions to the welcoming city ordinance. Those exceptions had allowed police to cooperate with immigration authorities in certain situations.</p><p>Eliminating the exceptions gave immigrants confidence to get jobs, and work with police to solve crimes, he said.</p><p>Changing that now, he said, would create two classes of arrivals: Venezuelans who arrived in time to qualify for Temporary Protected Status, which guards against deportation — and everyone else.</p><p>Those immigrants, he said, would be forced back underground, unable to fully participate in the economy and reluctant to report crimes.</p><p>At Wednesday’s Council meeting, Beale said he also plans to introduce a companion ordinance requiring at least 30 days’ notice to a local alderperson, as well as that Council member’s written approval, before a “residential shelter or housing facility for more than 12 individuals” can be located in their ward. The only exceptions would be locations authorized by the full Council.</p><p><i>Contributing: Michael Loria, a staff reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times via </i><a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   ><i>Report for America,</i></a><i> a not-for-profit journalism program that aims to bolster the paper’s coverage of communities on the South Side and West Side.</i></p><div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module  data-align-floatRight>\n    \n        <div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\">More coverage of migrants in Chicago</div>\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    <div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"><h3>More coverage of migrants in Chicago</h3><h4>Long waits for work visas</h4><ul><li id=\"x1mf2h\"><a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/25/23836765/migrants-work-permits-asylum-seekers-jobs\"  target=\"_blank\"   >Asylum-seekers’ long wait for work permits: ‘It feels terrible, especially because I’m used to working’</a></li><li id=\"jcIP8t\"><a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2023/8/30/23852113/migrant-worker-permits-biden-pritzker-chicago-illinois\"  target=\"_blank\"   >Chicago Democrats are pushing Biden to speed up work permits for migrants.

Tammy Duckworth on Tuesday joined a growing chorus of Democratic senators calling for the resignation of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who is facing federal corruption charges, while Sen. Dick Durbin,  the number two Democrat in the chamber, is stopping short of asking the indicted lawmaker to step down.</p><p>Though Menendez denies the charges and intends to fight them, “the fact remains these are really serious and deeply troubling allegations of abuse of the public trust and corruption,” Duckworth, D-Ill., told the Chicago Sun-Times. “I think he should resign as senator.</p><p>“I don’t know how anyone could mount an effective defense with such serious charges, while also fully representing their constituents at the same time,” Duckworth said.</p><p>It’s rare that Durbin and Duckworth are out of step. </p><p>But Durbin, D-Ill.,  is sticking to a playbook that for now, is giving Menendez space and time to see that he has lost the faith of a number of his colleagues — some of whose re-elections in 2024 could be imperiled if he does not resign. </p><p>The Menendez scandal — replete with gold bars and bags of cash found in his home — will also be a headache for President Joe Biden if he remains in office. Biden heads into the 2024 election framing his likely rival, former President Donald Trump — facing four criminal indictments — as corrupt and unfit to serve.</p><p>House Democrats have spoken as one in calling for Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., facing corruption charges, to quit, so the question is, why not the same treatment for Menendez?</p><p>Durbin for now is in line with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. — the top Democratic senator — in not piling on days after the Friday indictment where Menendez and his wife, Nadine, are accused of taking bribes from three New Jersey businessmen, who were also charged in the scheme to help the Egyptian government.</p><p>Between 2018 and 2022, the alleged bribes to Menendez and his wife came in the form of gold bars, a Mercedes, home mortgage payments and cash totaling $480,000 found in their home.</p><p> “Not only is this abuse of the public trust, but this is potentially engaging with a foreign nation or foreign government that you know, as a veteran, is something that troubles me,” said Duckworth, a wounded Iraq war vet.</p><p></p><p>In 2016, Duckworth called for now former Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., to resign after a woman accused him of an unwanted kiss, and seven other women said he made unwanted advances. </p><p>In a 2019 New Yorker interview, Duckworth expressed some regrets, telling author Jane Mayer  that the Senate Ethics Committee should have first taken up Franken’s case and “We needed more facts. That due process didn’t happen is not good for our democracy.”</p><p>I asked Duckworth about the Franken case, and if it informed her decision about Menendez. “These are two different cases,” she said. Franken “at the time was not being charged by a federal prosecutor.”</p><p></p><p>On CNN Sunday Durbin, asked about Menendez, declined a chance to ask him to quit. “This is a very serious charge. There’s no question about it. But it bears reminding us of what I’ve said about the indictments against Donald Trump equally serious charges. These are, in fact, indictments that [have] to be proven under the rule of law. The person who is accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence.”</p><p> Asked by host Dana Bash if Menendez, up in 2024, should run again, Durbin seemed to send a signal about discouraging a Menendez reelection bid in the midst of a scandal. Said Durbin, “And whether or not he will run for reelection remains to be seen.”</p><p></p><p>Menendez stepped aside as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but he had no choice. Senate rules say members charged with a felony have to relinquish their gavel. </p><p>With Duckworth, at least 22 senators have called for Menendez to step aside, with the numbers growing after Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on Tuesday — a Menendez friend — urged him to quit.</p><p>In his statement, Booker noted that this is the second time Menendez is facing federal corruption charges, with his 2017 case ending with a hung jury.</p><p>The new indictment, Booker said, is “one that contains shocking allegations of corruption and specific, disturbing details of wrongdoing.”</p><p></p><p>“The details of the allegations against Senator Menendez are of such a nature that the faith and trust of New Jerseyans as well as those he must work with in order to be effective have been shaken to the core.”</p><p>Saying it is a mistake for him not to resign, Booker, “Stepping down is not an admission of guilt but an acknowledgment that holding public office often demands tremendous sacrifices at great personal cost. Senator Menendez has made these sacrifices in the past to serve. And in this case he must do so again. I believe stepping down is best for those Senator Menendez has spent his life serving.” <br></p>",
